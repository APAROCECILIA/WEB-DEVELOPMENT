        Mrs. Anywar Grace.
        we are three children at home and apparently we stay at Bukoto  Mulimira Zone where my father built a 
        a house.

        I graduated from kindergaten in 2007 at <strong>Gods' Glory Nursery School</strong> and picked on my primary studies from 
       <strong> St. James Biina Primary School</strong> but unfortunately i couldn't complete my primary four because that is when
        suddenly shifted to Bukoto and i had to miss my second term results.
        I was taken to<strong> Shimoni Demonstration School</strong> to complete my primary studies. 
        In 2014, I completed primary Seven and I continued to <strong>Kololo Senior Secondary School </strong>where i completed 
        O & A level studies and apparently I am persuing my first degree in Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
